# Nonlinear Matrix Decomposition

Direct python port of https://gitlab.com/ngillis/ReLU-NMD/ (`a_nmd.py`, `nmd_3b.py`) and
https://github.com/nothing2wang/NMD-TM (`nmd_t.py`) that implement algorithms for the
nonlinear matrix decomposition problem outlined in [1].

The implementations in this repo are direct ports for educational purposes. Do use with caution. 
For proper implementations check the [nomad](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nomad) package.
